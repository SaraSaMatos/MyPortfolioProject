            <p class="education-details mt-1"> I have a Bachelor degree in Biomedical Sciences and a Master degree in Molecular Biology in Health.   </br> After some years working in scientific research field, I became interested in Marketing and Communication, so I attended a Post-graduation course in Pharmaceutical Marketing & Business Development. Since then, my interest about Marketing as evolved and I have been doing several courses to deepen my knowledge it that field: Digital Marketing & Business Analytics, Product Management & Business Development. </br> Recently I have worked in a Digital Marketing agency, where I had close contact with Web Developers. And, just like that I get interested in coding. I have attended 2 courses now, and I am in the middle of the 3rd, where I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other techniques common used by developers. See my SheCodes Certificates:

          <p class="professionalLife-details mt-3"> I started my carrer as a researcher in the Health field, first as a Fish Facility technicias and later as R&D Lab Manager. After 3 years working as a researcher, I felt the need to change and look for a new challenge in a recent field of interest - Marketing. </br> There was when my marketeer life began. I start working in the Pharmaceutical industry, first as a Marketing trainee and after a year, I was promoted to Product Manager Junior. </br> After that experience, I had also worked in the Pharmaceutical Medical department, but my main focus was getting back to Marketing. In 2019, I had an amazing opportunity to enroll in a Marketing Manager and Business Developer position in a Genetic Diagnosis Laboratory. Here I had my first contact with managing social media and the company corporate website - the first contact with back-end work. </br> I enjoyed so much working in Digital Marketing and the back-end of the corporate website that I wanted to learn and practice more. </br> With that in mind I moved once more, this time for a Digital marketing agency where I was responsible for the creation of social media content, campaign performance analysis, and also managed clients corporate website contents. The interest about back-end development increased even more and I decided to invest some time learning how to code. </br> Now, I am working in a different field, Food and Beverages, as a Lead Gen Campaing Specialist. </p>
